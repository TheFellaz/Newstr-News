## 1. Introduction

**Provide a short paragraph that describes your system. This paragraph should contain the value proposition and the description of the main features of the software. At the end of the introduction, include links to your project on GitHub and Trello.**

Our system, Newster-News, is an online news application that allows users to customize a daily newsletter. Our app saves user preferences about news topics they would like to receive, and the frequency at which they want to receive news. The system will then automatically fetch news relevant to the user’s interests, then send that news to their email.

  

Our system presents a frontend UI to the client using a React.js server responsible for signing up users, login and logout, and setting user preferences. The backend Spring server is responsible for handling a MySQL database and using a few API’s to fetch news articles, then send them by email to the user.

## 3. Tests

**You should implement automated tests that aim to verify the correct behavior of your code.**

**Test framework you used to develop your tests**

`Backend: Junit4`

**Link to your GitHub folder**

[GitHub](https://github.com/TheFellaz/Newstr-News)

**Front End Test**
For testing in the frontend, we used Jest. React comes with some Jest functionality meaning all we had to do was configure it correctly for our project. Tests were implemented in the same package as the object of the test for better grouping.

[Test 1](https://github.com/TheFellaz/Newstr-News/blob/main/newsterweb/src/App.test.js)

**Back End Tests**

For testing in the backend, we used Junit 4/5. Spring boot comes equipped with the means to easily implement Junit testing on a large scale.

## 5. Code Quality
Our team used a variety of policies to manage code quality. First of in the frontend, we used the code formatter ‘Prettier’ to make sure everything was correctly formatted.

  

In github, we used commit and push conventions to make clear to every group member what we did in this commit or push.

  

Commit Conventions

[Add, Modify, Remove] [Commit message] [#issue]

  
  

In the backend, we used Intellij’s in house formatter, which kept lines short enough and positioned curly braces in the proper locations.

  

Also, generally we tried hard to follow the camel case for our code. To make clean code we did code-review once a week.

  

Also, for the github we setup the label and milestone so we can manage good code.

## 6. Lessons learned

**In retrospect, the team should have started the bigger requirements earlier. Doing this would ease the stress needed to complete the project. The team would need to establish more reliable lines of communication and communicate the expectations of the project effectively.**
