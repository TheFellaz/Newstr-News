## 1. Introduction

**Provide a short paragraph that describes your system. This paragraph should contain the value proposition and the description of the main features of the software. At the end of the introduction, include links to your project on GitHub and Trello.**

Our system, Newster-News, is an online news application that allows users to customize a daily newsletter. Our app saves user preferences about news topics they would like to receive, and the frequency at which they want to receive news. The system will then automatically fetch news relevant to the user’s interests, then send that news to their email.

  

Our system presents a frontend UI to the client using a React.js server responsible for signing up users, login and logout, and setting user preferences. The backend Spring server is responsible for handling a MySQL database and using a few API’s to fetch news articles, then send them by email to the user.

## 2. Implemented requirements

**List in this section, the requirements and associated pull request that you implemented for this release, following the example below---include the description 
of the requirement, a link to the issue, a link to the pull request(s) that implement the requirement, who implemented the requirement, who approved it, and a 
print screen that depicts the implemented feature (if applicable). I expect that you implement the features you specified in your MVP (c.f. D.2 Requirements). 
Order the requirements below by the name of the student who implemented them. All the members of the group should have worked on implementation activities and 
submitted pull requests. Only stable code should be included in the release. The code that is still under development should be in branches.**
